🎓 AI PaperIQ – Research Summarizer & Analyzer

AI PaperIQ is an intelligent web application built with Streamlit that integrates Google Gemini API and ArXiv/Core research APIs to automatically fetch, summarize, and analyze research papers.
It provides a clean chat-style interface and insightful visualizations comparing the input and summarized text.

✨ Key Features

✅ AI Summarization — Uses Gemini API to produce structured, human-like summaries of research papers.
📚 Research Paper Fetching — Retrieves the latest academic papers from ArXiv or Core APIs by topic or keyword.
💬 Chatbot Interface — User-friendly Streamlit-based chat layout for smooth interaction (“Summarize this paper…”).
📊 Visualization Dashboard — Compares input vs summarized content with insights like:

Word count comparison

Keyword overlap and distribution

Semantic similarity

Readability metrics

🧠 Multi-Input Support — Accepts text, PDF uploads, or topic-based queries.
🔗 Reference Extraction — Displays source URLs or paper citations for context.
